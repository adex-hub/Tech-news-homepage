- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links
- Live Site URL: [https://technewsappbyade.netlify.app]

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid only (no Flexbox)
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

The only new thing I learnt is that it's possible to re-order grid systems using the CSS `order` property and assigning it a keyword that specifies the so called order. For example...
```css
.grid-element1{
  order: 2;
}
.grid-element2{
  order: 1
}
```
Google and read more on CSS order property for more info.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I want to learn how to build these kind of things with tools like Vue and React.
